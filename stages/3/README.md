===============

## Install Elm

Visit http://elm-lang.org/install to get set up.

Not required, but **highly** recommended: [install elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format#installation-) and integrate it into your editor so that it runs on save.

## Install the Project

Run this at the terminal:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run Tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Engage Auto-Rebuilding

```bash
npm run watch
```
