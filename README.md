Getting Started
===============

## Install Nodejs 4.0.0 or higher

http://nodejs.org

## Install Elm

Visit http://elm-lang.org/install to get set up.

Not required, but **highly** recommended: [install elm-format](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format#installation-) and integrate it into your editor so that it runs on save.

## Clone this repository

Run this at the terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-workshop.git
cd elm-workshop
```

## Install supporting tools

Run this at the terminal:

```bash
npm install -g elm-live@2.0.4 elm-test@0.16.1-alpha3 elm-css@0.4.0
```

This could take several minutes.

## Start with Stage 1

Run this at the terminal:

```bash
cd stages/1
```

Now head over to the [README for stage 1](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-workshop/tree/master/stages/1)!
